# üìä Help me with my data

Welcome to the "Help me with my data" project! This web development endeavor aims to provide a user-friendly platform for data preprocessing, analysis, and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA). Whether you're new to data science or a seasoned practitioner, this tool will assist you in efficiently preparing your dataset and gaining valuable insights.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About the Simulator

The simulator offers a seamless experience for data preprocessing and analysis. Here's what you can expect:

1. **Data Input:**
   - Upload an Excel or CSV file for automatic configuration of the dataset.
   - Alternatively, opt for manual entry, providing the number of rows, columns, and entering values individually.

2. **Data Overview:**
   - After data input, view a comprehensive overview of your dataset, displaying all columns and rows in a page view format.

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Utilize the transform option to clean and preprocess your data efficiently.
     - Replace missing or incorrect values.
     - Options include:
       - series mean,
       - series median,
       - nearby points mean (based on a user-defined hyperparameter),
       - nearby points median,
       - interpolation (coming soon).

4. **Analysis:**
   - Choose dependent and independent variables to proceed with the analysis.
   - Options include:
     - Descriptive analysis:
         - frequency,
         - mean,
         - standard deviation, and
         - Interquartile Range (IQR) values.
     - Correlations: Examine correlations within the entire dataset or a subset of columns.
     - Regression: Perform linear regression analysis.
     - Clustering: Utilize K-means clustering with customizable parameters such as distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan, <add more here>).
